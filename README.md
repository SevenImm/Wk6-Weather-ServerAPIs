# Wk6-Weather-ServerAPIs

## Feature/Body:
For this feature branch, I want to build the main body of the weather dashboard.
I want to recreate the body using bootstrap.

## Feature/Scripts:
For this branch, I want to build the logic script to call the API and get the weather.
# Feature/ScriptsV.1:
For this commit, I want to check/store cities into local storage.
- Check **if** user has previously looked for cities before.
- **IF** no object is stored, then proceed the function of adding the city into the object.
(In this case I manually added the data in, since the event listeners/function has not been written.)
